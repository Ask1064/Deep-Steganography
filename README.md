# Deep-Steganography
Steganography using Deep Learning
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection. The secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. It mainly refers to the practice of hiding a type of data into another type of data such as text in image, or image in image.  
  
Steganalysis's primary goals are to identify questionable data streams, ascertain whether or not secret messages have been encoded into them, and, if necessary, extract the concealed data.  
  
In this project, we created a steganographic model which could bypass such steganalysis tool. We also applied the steganalysis tool to traditional LSB method, which was found much less effective compared to our deep steganography model.
